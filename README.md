# PixelAddict Retro Arcade

This repository hosts the static front-end for the PixelAddict arcade homepage and supporting pages.

## Local preview

1. From the project root, start a static file server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser to explore the CRT-styled homepage with neon theme.

Screenshots and preview assets can be captured by running a server locally and using a browser automation tool such as Playwright.
